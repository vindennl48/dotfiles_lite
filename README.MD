# Dotfiles Lite

Initially, this repo was designed to install a simplified version of my
dotfiles. However, it has slowly become my main repo. We shall see how this
progresses..

## How to Install

Clone this repo down into your home directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/vindennl48/dotfiles_lite
```

Then activate the install script:

```
cd dotfiles_lite
sudo chmod a+x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

The script will guide you through the install process and what prerequisite
software you will need to install.

## Arch

This is also where we will store some Arch install scripts for various things
like ssh, Nvidia, etc.

Thats it!
